              Constellations - groups of stars that occupy certain areas in the sky and form some kind of figure. Constellations are usually formed by the brightest stars visible to the naked eye, although these figures are sometimes difficult to grasp, and some shapeless and dim.</p>

              The figures of the constellations are imaginary, they just help to better remember and find them in the sky. Each star actually exists on its own and is in no way connected with others. Two stars of the same constellation, located close to the sky, can actually be removed from us at very different distances - one for ten light years, and the other for a thousand.</p>

            <p class="main-stars__descr">Therefore, the division of stars into a constellation is purely conditional, for the convenience of search and mapping. So the water on Earth is conditionally divided into oceans, although they all form one World Ocean. But in ancient times, people actually saw figures of people and animals in star placers, and gave them names. Many of them have survived to our time, and the boundaries of the constellations share these figures.</p>

In Russia, the following principle applies: the farther south the city, the better the constellation is visible. But in our country there is no way to see it in its entirety.

There is another type - the centaur Foul, Heracles sent him to heaven. He shot a centaur with a poisoned arrow.</p>
